## 📖 Introduction

Throughout this course, we'll use a consistent, realistic case study to demonstrate software analysis and design concepts. Meet the **School Management System (SMS)**—a comprehensive solution for small-to-medium educational institutions.

This isn't just a theoretical example. Every requirement, user story, and design decision reflects real-world challenges that schools face daily. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand not just how to build software, but why we make specific design and planning decisions.

**Reading Time:** 30 minutes  
**Activity Time:** 15 minutes

## 🏫 The Business Problem

### Current State: Greenfield Academy

**Greenfield Academy** is a private K-12 school with 500 students, 40 teachers, and 5 administrative staff. Like many small schools, they're drowning in paperwork and manual processes.

#### A Day in the Life

**7:45 AM - Ms. Sarah Chen, Math Teacher**

```

"I spend the first 20 minutes of every class taking attendance and recording it. That's 100 minutes per week just on attendance—time I could spend actually teaching."

**9:30 AM - Mrs. Rodriguez, School Administrator**

```mermaid

    style G fill:#ff9800
```

"I get 50+ calls per day from parents asking about grades, attendance, and schedules. Each call takes 5-10 minutes to look up information in our filing cabinets."

**2:00 PM - Mr. Johnson, Principal**

"We just failed our accreditation audit because our attendance records weren't complete. We're spending $15,000 on a consultant to help us get back into compliance. If we had digital records with audit trails, this wouldn't have happened."

**4:00 PM - David's Mom, Parent**

"My son David got a D in Math, but I had no idea he was struggling until report cards came out. If I'd known earlier, I could have gotten him a tutor. Why don't teachers communicate with parents anymore?"

### Pain Points Quantified

```mermaid

| **Opportunity Cost** | Immeasurable | Teachers not teaching, admins not planning |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT** | **$116,000** | Direct measurable costs only |

#### Strategic Concerns

Beyond immediate costs, the Principal faces strategic challenges:

## 🔑 Key Concepts Summary

### Critical Points to Remember

1. **Business Context is Essential**
   - Software solves business problems
   - Always quantify the pain and value
   - Understand before solving

2. **Stakeholder Management**
   - Different stakeholders have different needs
   - Some needs conflict—prioritization required
   - Engage stakeholders throughout project

3. **Requirements Must Be Specific**
   - Vague: "System should be fast"
   - Specific: "Page load < 2 seconds, 95th percentile"

4. **Success Criteria Beyond "It Works"**
   - Technical success (no bugs) ≠ project success
   - Business outcomes matter most
   - User adoption is key metric

5. **Competitive Advantage Matters**
   - Understand the market
   - Know your competitors
   - Differentiate clearly

### Project Foundation Checklist

```

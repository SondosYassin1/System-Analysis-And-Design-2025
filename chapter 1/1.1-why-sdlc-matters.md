---

## 📖 Introduction

Have you ever wondered why some software projects succeed brilliantly while others fail spectacularly? Why do some apps work flawlessly while others crash constantly? The answer often lies in how the software was developed—specifically, whether a structured Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) was followed.

In this section, you'll discover why SDLC is not just academic theory, but a critical framework that determines project success or failure.

**Reading Time:** 25 minutes  
**Hands-on Activity:** 10 minutes

## 💥 When Software Goes Wrong: Real-World Disasters

### Case Study 1: Healthcare.gov Launch Disaster (2013)

**The Project:**
The U.S. government's Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) required a website where millions of Americans could shop for health insurance.

**What Happened:**
- **Launch Date:** October 1, 2013
- **Budget:** $840 million initially spent
- **Result:** Complete failure on day one

**The Failure:**

    style C fill:#ef9a9a
    style D fill:#e57373
    style E fill:#ef5350
    style F fill:#f44336
    style G fill:#e53935
```

**Root Causes:**
1. ❌ **No Clear Requirements:** Different stakeholders had conflicting visions
2. ❌ **Poor Testing:** Inadequate load testing before launch
3. ❌ **Integration Issues:** 55+ contractors working without coordination
4. ❌ **No Risk Management:** Critical issues ignored until too late

    style C fill:#ffcc80
    style D fill:#ffb74d
    style E fill:#ffa726
    style F fill:#ff5722
```

**Root Causes:**
1. ❌ **Requirements Shortcuts:** Cost-cutting led to single-sensor dependency
2. ❌ **Inadequate Testing:** Software not tested under all conditions
3. ❌ **Poor Documentation:** Pilots unaware of critical system behavior
4. ❌ **No Safety Analysis:** Risk assessment insufficient for life-critical software
5. ❌ **Schedule Pressure:** Market competition rushed development

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Safety-critical systems require rigorous SDLC**
- Testing must cover all edge cases
- Documentation is not optional
- Requirements must prioritize safety over cost
- External validation and verification are essential

## 💰 The Cost of Poor Planning

### Financial Impact Statistics

Research shows the true cost of software project failures:

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| **Standish Group CHAOS Report** | 66% of software projects fail or are challenged |
| **IBM Study** | Cost to fix a bug in production: **100x more** than fixing in design |
| **Gartner Research** | Poor requirements cost $1M+ per year for average enterprise |
| **McKinsey Study** | Large IT projects run 45% over budget, 7% over time |

### Cost Multiplication by Phase

When defects are found and fixed at different stages:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements<br/>$1] --> B[Design<br/>$5]
    B --> C[Implementation<br/>$10]
    C --> D[Testing<br/>$20]
    D --> E[Production<br/>$100]
    
    style A fill:#c8e6c9
    style B fill:#fff9c4
    style C fill:#ffcc80
    style D fill:#ffab91
    style E fill:#ef5350
```

**Example Calculation:**

A simple requirement error (e.g., incorrect data validation rule):
- **Found in Requirements Phase:** $100 to fix (1 hour discussion)
- **Found in Design Phase:** $500 to fix (redesign + documentation update)
- **Found in Implementation:** $1,000 to fix (code changes + retesting)
- **Found in Testing:** $2,000 to fix (code fix + regression testing)
- **Found in Production:** $10,000+ to fix (emergency patch + customer impact + reputation)

## 🎓 Hands-On Activity: Analyze a Failure

### Activity: "What Went Wrong?"

**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Format:** Individual or small groups

**Scenario:**
A mobile banking app was released with the following issues:
- App crashes when users try to transfer more than $1,000
- Users can see other customers' account balances
- App works only on newest phones, crashes on older devices
- Forgot password feature doesn't work
- No way to contact customer support from the app

**Your Task:**
1. Identify at least 5 SDLC failures that led to these issues
2. In which phase(s) could each issue have been prevented?
3. Estimate the cost impact (low/medium/high/critical)

**Template:**

| Issue | SDLC Failure | Phase to Fix | Cost Impact |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Crashes on transfers > $1000 | | | |
| Security breach (seeing others' data) | | | |
| Device compatibility | | | |
| Password reset broken | | | |
| No support contact | | | |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which issue is most critical? Why?
2. What would have prevented these issues?
3. How much do you think these failures cost the bank?
4. What should the bank do now?

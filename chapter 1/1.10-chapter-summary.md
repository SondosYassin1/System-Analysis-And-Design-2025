### Critical Principles

**1. Software Failures Are Expensive**
- 66% of projects fail or are challenged
- Bugs cost 100× more in production vs. requirements phase
- Poor planning causes most failures
- Healthcare.gov: $1B+ due to lack of SDLC

**2. Structured Approach Increases Success**
- Projects with SDLC have 2× higher success rate
- Early planning prevents costly rework
- Regular inspection and adaptation catch issues early
- Documentation enables knowledge transfer

**3. SDLC Phases Are Universal**
```
Planning → Requirements → Design → Implementation 
→ Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
```
Every model includes these, but orders/iterates differently.

**4. Context Determines Methodology**
- Stable requirements → Traditional (Waterfall/V-Model)
- Changing requirements → Agile (Scrum)
- High risk → Spiral
- Continuous delivery → Incremental/Kanban
- No silver bullet—choose based on context

**5. Agile Values Over Processes**
```
Individuals & Interactions > Processes & Tools
Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation
Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation
Responding to Change > Following a Plan
```

**6. Scrum is Empirical**
```
Transparency → Inspection → Adaptation
```
Make work visible, inspect regularly, adapt based on findings.

**7. Estimation Is Relative**
- Story points, not hours
- Team-specific scale
- Velocity emerges over time (3-5 sprints)
- Use for planning, not performance measurement

**8. Tools Enable, Not Replace, Process**
- Git for version control (essential)
- Jira/Trello for project management
- CI/CD for quality and speed
- Slack for communication
- Tools serve the team, not vice versa

## ✅ Answers to Self-Check Questions

### Section 1.1: Why SDLC Matters

1. **What was the primary cost of the Healthcare.gov failure?**
   - Direct cost: $1+ billion ($840M initial + $175M fixes)
   - Indirect: Reputation damage, political fallout, delayed benefits to citizens

2. **Why does it cost 100× more to fix a bug in production vs. requirements phase?**
   - Requirements: Quick discussion/change (1 hour)
   - Production: Code fix + testing + emergency deploy + customer impact + rollback plan + reputation damage

3. **Name three benefits of using a structured SDLC approach.**
   - Early defect detection (cheaper to fix)
   - Clear communication (everyone knows the plan)
   - Risk management (identify problems before they occur)
   - Predictability (know timeline and budget)
   - Quality (built-in checkpoints)
   - (Any 3 are correct)

4. **What was the "software crisis" and how did SDLC help solve it?**
   - Crisis (1960s-80s): Projects chronically late, over budget, poor quality, no process
   - SDLC solution: Structured approaches, defined phases, quality gates, systematic testing
   - Result: Higher success rates, predictable outcomes

5. **In the Knight Capital case, what single SDLC practice could have prevented the disaster?**
   - Proper deployment process/change management

---

### Section 1.3: Traditional SDLC Models

1. **What is the main difference between Waterfall and V-Model?**
   - V-Model adds testing emphasis at each phase
   - V-Model maps each development phase to corresponding test level
   - V-Model has verification and validation built in
   - Otherwise similar sequential structure

2. **Why is the Spiral model called "risk-driven"?**
   - Each spiral iteration focuses on identifying and addressing highest risks
   - Risk analysis drives what to do next
   - Prototypes built to mitigate risks
   - Continue spiraling until risks acceptable

3. **What's the key advantage of the Incremental model over Waterfall?**
   - Earlier delivery of working software (increments)
   - Can get feedback on early increments
   - Users see value sooner
   - Lower risk (prove concept early)
   - Can stop if budget runs out (have some working software)

4. **When would you NOT use Waterfall model?**
   - Requirements unclear or changing
   - Need early user feedback
   - High risk/uncertainty
   - Long project duration
   - Innovation required
   - Market conditions volatile

5. **Which model emphasizes testing the most?**
   - V-Model (testing is core focus, not afterthought)

6. **Can multiple increments be developed in parallel? Why or why not?**
   - Yes, if:
     - Different teams available
     - No dependencies between increments
     - Clear interfaces defined
   - Benefit: Faster total delivery

7. **What type of projects is Spiral model best suited for?**
   - Large, complex projects
   - High risk/uncertainty
   - R&D projects
   - New technology
   - Expensive failures
   - Long duration (can afford multiple spirals)

8. **What's the difference between verification and validation in V-Model?**
   - Verification: "Are we building the product right?" (matches specifications)
   - Validation: "Are we building the right product?" (meets user needs)

---

### Section 1.4: Agile Methodologies

1. **Name the four values of the Agile Manifesto.**
   1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
   2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
   3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
   4. Responding to change over following a plan

2. **What does "working software over comprehensive documentation" mean?**
   - Prioritize delivering functional software first
   - Documentation serves working software (not vice versa)
   - "Just enough" documentation
   - Does NOT mean zero documentation
   - Focus on value delivery

3. **How does Agile handle changing requirements differently than Waterfall?**
   - Waterfall: Change is problem, controlled via change requests
   - Agile: Change is expected, welcomed as competitive advantage
   - Waterfall: Expensive to change
   - Agile: Product Backlog continuously refined, easy to adjust

4. **What is the main difference between Scrum and Kanban?**
   - Scrum: Fixed-length sprints, defined roles, prescribed ceremonies
   - Kanban: Continuous flow, no sprints, no prescribed roles
   - Scrum: Commitment to sprint goal
   - Kanban: No commitments, pull from backlog as capacity allows
   - Scrum: Velocity metrics
   - Kanban: Cycle time, throughput metrics

5. **What is TDD and why is it important in XP?**
   - TDD: Test-Driven Development
   - Process: Write test → Write code to pass test → Refactor
   - Important because:
     - Ensures testability
     - Prevents bugs
     - Better design
     - Confidence to refactor
     - Living documentation

6. **Name three scenarios where traditional methods might be better than Agile.**
   - Fixed regulatory requirements (FDA, etc.)
   - Safety-critical systems requiring extensive documentation
   - Fixed-price contracts with locked scope
   - Very large teams (50+) without Agile experience
   - Distributed teams with poor communication infrastructure
   - Stable, well-understood requirements
   - (Any 3 are correct)

7. **What does "self-organizing team" mean?**
   - Team decides HOW to do work (not told by manager)
   - Collective ownership of work
   - Team members collaborate to solve problems
   - No task assignment from outside
   - Team accountability for results

8. **How often should working software be delivered in Agile?**
   - Every sprint (1-4 weeks, typically 2 weeks)
   - Scrum: End of each sprint
   - Kanban: Continuously as items complete
   - Principle: "Weeks not months"

### Section 1.5: Scrum Deep Dive

1. **What are the three Scrum roles and their primary responsibilities?**
   - **Product Owner:** Maximize product value, manage backlog, prioritize work
   - **Scrum Master:** Servant leader, remove impediments, coach team on Scrum
   - **Development Team:** Build increment, self-organize, cross-functional

2. **How long should a Daily Scrum last? What are the three questions?**
   - **Duration:** 15 minutes (timeboxed)
   - **Questions:**
     1. What did I do yesterday?
     2. What will I do today?
     3. Are there any impediments?

3. **What's the difference between Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective?**
   - **Sprint Review:** WHAT was built (demo increment, gather feedback on product)
   - **Sprint Retrospective:** HOW we worked (process improvement, team dynamics)

4. **Who can cancel a Sprint and why would they?**
   - **Who:** Only the Product Owner
   - **Why:** Sprint Goal becomes obsolete (major market change, company pivot, requirements invalidated)
   - **Rare:** Should be exceptional circumstance

5. **What is velocity and how is it calculated?**
   - **Velocity:** Amount of work team completes per sprint (story points)
   - **Calculation:** Sum of story points for completed stories in sprint
   - **Average:** Typically average last 3-5 sprints for planning

6. **Explain the concept of story points vs. hours.**
   - **Story Points:** Relative sizing, considers complexity/effort/uncertainty, team-specific, doesn't change
   - **Hours:** Absolute time, varies by person, less accurate for estimation
   - **Story Points better for:** Estimation, long-term planning, avoiding micro-management

7. **What is Definition of Done and why does it matter?**
   - **Definition:** Shared understanding of "complete" (code + tests + review + docs + deployed)
   - **Why:** Prevents "done but not really," ensures quality, enables transparency, creates shippable increments

8. **How does the Sprint Backlog differ from the Product Backlog?**
   - **Product Backlog:** All work for entire product (prioritized, evolving)
   - **Sprint Backlog:** Work selected for current sprint only (fixed during sprint, includes tasks)

   - Create database schema
   - Build design system
   - Enable team to move fast in Sprint 1+
   - Avoid technical debt from rushed setup

2. **What is the Sprint Goal for Sprint 3 and how does it guide story selection?**
   - **Goal:** "Classes can be created, students enrolled, and teachers assigned"
   - **Guides selection:** Only select stories related to class management, exclude unrelated features
   - **Provides focus:** Team knows priority is class functionality

3. **Why is Sprint 2 slightly over-committed (42 points), and what should the team do?**
   - US-015 (Bulk Import) added 8 extra points
   - **Options:**
     - Move US-015 to later sprint (recommended)
     - Accept 42 points and work efficiently
     - Reduce scope of US-015
   - **Decision:** Move US-015 (nice-to-have) to keep sprint realistic

4. **How many total story points are planned across all 7 sprints?**

5. **Which sprint delivers the most critical user-facing value? Why?**
   - **Sprint 4: Attendance Tracking**
   - Why: Addresses biggest teacher pain point (15-20 min per class saved)
   - First feature that provides daily value
   - Parent notifications provide immediate communication benefit
   - (Alternative answer: Sprint 1 authentication - nothing works without it)

6. **What is the purpose of making Sprint 7 flexible/over-committed?**
   - Buffer for unknowns and carry-over work
   - Bug fixes can expand/contract as needed
   - Final polish and adjustments
   - Ensures launch readiness
   - Better to have extra capacity than be short

7. **Why must US-018 (Enroll Students) come after US-016 (Create Classes)?**
   - **Dependency:** Can't enroll students in non-existent classes
   - Technical: Database foreign key requires classes table populated
   - Logical: Classes must exist before enrollment

8. **How does the burn-up chart help track project progress?**
   - Shows cumulative work completed over time
   - Visualizes progress toward total scope
   - Identifies if team is on track for completion

## 📝 Assessment Answer Key

### Part 1 Answers:
1. b, 2. b, 3. c, 4. c, 5. c, 6. b, 7. c, 8. b, 9. a, 10. c, 11. b, 12. c, 13. b, 14. b, 15. c, 16. c, 17. b, 18. c, 19. b, 20. c

### Part 2 Sample Answers:

**1. Functional vs Non-Functional:**
Functional requirements define what the system does (features/capabilities), like "users can log in" or "system calculates grades automatically." Non-functional requirements define how well the system performs, like "page loads in < 2 seconds" or "supports 500 concurrent users" or "99.5% uptime."

**2. Three Scrum Roles:**
Product Owner maximizes product value and manages the prioritized backlog. Scrum Master serves the team by removing impediments and coaching Scrum practices. Development Team (3-9 people) is cross-functional and self-organizing, responsible for delivering the increment.

**3. Sprint Goal Importance:**
A Sprint Goal provides focus and coherence to the sprint, guiding daily decisions. It allows flexibility in HOW to achieve the goal while maintaining the WHAT. It also helps the team make trade-offs if issues arise during the sprint.

**4. Agile Manifesto Values:**
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

**5. Velocity and Planning:**
Velocity (average story points completed per sprint) helps teams forecast capacity for sprint planning. Teams use historical velocity to commit to realistic amounts of work, avoiding over-commitment and ensuring sustainable pace.

### Part 3 Sample Answer:

**1. SDLC Model:** Scrum/Agile
- Requirements are evolving (not fixed)
- Need rapid feedback and iterations
- Small team fits Scrum perfectly
- Monthly investor demos align with sprint reviews
- Time to market critical in competitive space
- Budget-conscious (fail fast, pivot quickly)

**2. Project Structure:**
- 2-week sprints (6 sprints total in 3 months)
- Sprint 0: Setup (1 week) - infrastructure, design
- Sprint 1-2: MVP features (authentication, restaurant listings, basic ordering)
- Sprint 3-4: Payment and delivery tracking
- Sprint 5: Polish and performance
- Sprint 6: Final testing and launch prep
- Monthly stakeholder demos (every 2 sprints)

**3. Tools:**
- Git/GitHub: Version control (free)
- Trello: Project management (simple, free)
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD (free tier sufficient)
- Slack: Team communication (free)
- VS Code: Development environment (free)
- Total budget for tools: ~$0-200/month (mostly free)

**4. Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk: Requirements unclear → Mitigation: Weekly Product Owner meetings, frequent demos
- Risk: Small team, key person leaves → Mitigation: Pair programming, documentation
- Risk: 3-month deadline aggressive → Mitigation: MVP focus, cut nice-to-haves
- Risk: Technical challenges → Mitigation: Proof-of-concept in Sprint 0, early integration testing

## 🏫 School Management System Case Study

Throughout this chapter, we develop a complete use case model for a School Management System (the course's integrated project).

**See:** `3_case-study-school-system.md` for:
- Complete actor catalog (4 primary, 2 secondary)
- 30 use cases across all actors
- Fully-dressed examples
- UML diagrams
- User story backlog
- Traceability matrix

## 💡 Quick Tips for Success

### DO:
- ✅ Read sections in order (they build on each other)
- ✅ Do the self-check questions
- ✅ Practice with the School System case study
- ✅ Start your own project early
- ✅ Use proper UML tools (not PowerPoint!)
- ✅ Get feedback from peers

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip the fundamentals (3.1-3.2)
- ❌ Try to memorize everything
- ❌ Over-complicate diagrams
- ❌ Include implementation details
- ❌ Work alone - collaborate!

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

**"I don't understand actors vs stakeholders"**
→ Read section 3.2 carefully. All actors are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders interact with the system.

**"My use case diagram is too complicated"**
→ Review section 3.3. Aim for 5-15 use cases per diagram. Create multiple diagrams if needed.

**"When do I use include vs. extend?"**
→ Section 3.4 has a decision tree. Include = always happens, Extend = conditional.

**"My use case descriptions are too long/short"**
→ Check section 3.5 examples. Main scenario should be 8-15 steps.

### Study Group Recommended
Form groups of 3-4 students to:
- Review each other's diagrams
- Practice role-playing use cases
- Provide feedback on descriptions

# 3.13 Chapter 3 Summary

## What You've Learned

### Core Concepts

**Use Cases:**
- Visual models of system behavior
- Focus on user-system interaction
- Include actors, system boundary, use cases
- Show relationships (include, extend, generalization)

**User Stories:**
- Agile alternative to use cases
- Short, user-focused format
- Conversation starters, not specifications
- Include acceptance criteria

---

## Key Techniques

### 1. Use Case Modeling
✓ Identify actors systematically
✓ Discover use cases from requirements
✓ Create clear, readable diagrams
✓ Apply relationships appropriately
✓ Write detailed specifications

### 2. User Story Writing
✓ Follow standard format
✓ Apply INVEST criteria
✓ Write testable acceptance criteria
✓ Size stories appropriately
✓ Organize in backlogs and story maps

### 3. Integration
✓ Convert between formats
✓ Maintain traceability
✓ Choose right tool for situation
✓ Document effectively

- [ ] Consistent granularity
- [ ] Relationships used correctly
- [ ] No implementation details
- [ ] Professional appearance

### Use Case Specification Checklist
- [ ] Unique ID assigned
- [ ] Actors identified (primary, secondary)
- [ ] Clear preconditions
- [ ] Numbered main flow steps
- [ ] Complete alternative flows
- [ ] Measurable postconditions
- [ ] Special requirements noted
- [ ] Follows template structure

### User Story Checklist
- [ ] Standard format (As/I want/So that)
- [ ] INVEST criteria met
- [ ] Testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Estimated (story points)
- [ ] Prioritized
- [ ] Linked to epic
- [ ] Includes Definition of Done

❌ Missing alternative flows
❌ Wrong relationship directions

### User Story Mistakes
❌ Writing tasks instead of stories
❌ Too technical focus
❌ Missing acceptance criteria
❌ Stories too large
❌ Vague benefits
❌ Not testable

## Connection to Other Chapters

### From Chapter 2 (Requirements)
→ Requirements drive use case identification
→ SRS provides context for use cases
→ Stakeholders become actors

### To Chapter 4 (OO Analysis)
→ Use cases identify objects
→ Actors become classes
→ Scenarios drive sequence diagrams

### To Chapter 5 (UML Modeling)
→ Use case diagrams expand to full UML
→ Activity diagrams detail complex flows
→ Sequence diagrams show realization
